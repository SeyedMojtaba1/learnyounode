 ## HTTP UPPERCASERER (Exercise 12 of 13)  
   
  Write an HTTP server that receives only POST requests and converts  
  incoming POST body characters to upper-case and returns it to the client.  
   
  Your server should listen on the port provided by the first argument to  
  your program.

 ## HINTS  
   
  While you're not restricted to using the streaming capabilities of the  
  request and response objects, it will be much easier if you do.  
   
  There are a number of different packages in npm that you can use to  
  "transform" stream data as it's passing through. For this exercise the  
  through2-map package offers the simplest API.

  through2-map allows you to create a transform stream using only a single
  function that takes a chunk of data and returns a chunk of data. It's
  designed to work much like Array#map() but for streams:

     var map = require('through2-map')
     inStream.pipe(map(function (chunk) {
       return chunk.toString().split('').reverse().join('')
     })).pipe(outStream)

  In the above example, the incoming data from inStream is converted to a
  String (if it isn't already), the characters are reversed and the result
  is passed through to outStream. So we've made a chunk character reverser!
  Remember though that the chunk size is determined up-stream and you have
  little control over it for incoming data.

  To install through2-map type:

     $ npm install through2-map

  If you don't have an Internet connection, simply make a node_modules
  directory and copy the entire directory for the module you want to use
  from inside the learnyounode installation directory:

  file://E:\learnyounode\node_modules\learnyounode\node_modules\through2-map

  Documentation for through2-map has been installed along with learnyounode
  on your system and you can read them by pointing your browser here:
